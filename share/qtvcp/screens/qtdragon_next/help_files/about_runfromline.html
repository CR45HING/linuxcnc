<h1>RUN FROM LINE</h1>
<p>A gcode program can be started at any line by clicking on the desired line in the gcode display while in AUTO mode.
It is the operator’s responsibility to ensure the machine is in the desired operational mode.
When the program is started and the <button style='font-size:14px'>RUN FROM LINE</button> button is enabled, a dialog 
will be shown allowing the spindle direction and speed to be preset.
The start line is indicated in the box next to the <button style='font-size:14px'>RUN FROM LINE</button> button.</p>

<div class="admonition">
<p>Linuxcnc’s run-from-line is not very user friendly. eg. It does not start the spindle or confirm the proper tool.
It does not handle subroutines well. If used, it is best to start on a rapid move.</p>
