<h1>STYLESHEETS</h1>
<p>The appearance of the widgets in the QtDragon UI can be customized through the use of stylesheets. Upon initialization, QTVCP 
searches for stylesheets in the users CONFIG/qtdragon folder. If none are found, it will apply a default style from the 
/usr/share/qtvcp directory. To change the current style, press F12 (while the UI has focus) and interact with QTVCP's stylesheet 
editor dialog.</p>
<p>To quickly change the current style, you can select a style from the stylesheet combobox in the SETTINGS page. If any .qss files 
were found in the users config directory during initialization, this combobox contains a list of those files. If QTVCP didn't find 
any .qss files, the combobox contains a list of the styles from the default share folder.</p>
<p>This allows a user to easily modify an existing stylesheet or create a completely new and customized one. Any existing stylesheet 
could be used as a starting template. When placed in the CONFIG/qtdragon folder, it will be listed in the stylesheet combobox on the 
SETTINGS page.</p>
<h2>Creating Custom Stylesheets</h2>
Custom style sheets can be created by manually creating and editing a .qss file or with a SASS compiler like qtsass.
Using qtsass provides quick style changes and easier maintenance by breaking the style definitions into individual 
widget style definition files. By using variables for the style property settings, the stylesheet can be updated by
redefinging the variable definitions in the top level file. 
<p>See <i>https://pypi.org/project/qtsass/</i> for more information.</p>
